## Contribution

We were able create a fullstack react application through the utilization of Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize.

## Tests

Run "npm run dev" in the server side (backend) to have the port listen and conect to the database. Then run "npm run dev" in the client side (frontend) to have it's own port open and a webpage will run. Since the port in the backend is listening, the frontend will be able to fetch the Crypto Currencies and the Stocks when searched. Any Crypto Currencies or Stocks can then be added to the watchlist.
