## Description

An E-Commerce platform/appliation where a user is able to register and login successfully into the web page and then is able to look up different Crypto Currencies and Stocks that they want to. The Crypto Currencies will display data such as the name, symbol, price, last updated, change in volume and price change within the last 24 hours. The Stocks will display data such as the time it opened, the time it closed, the high and low price of the stock, and the volume. The user is also able to put wanted Crypto Currencies and Stocks into a watchlist as well.

## Installation

Clone the repository and make sure all keys/passwords are set up in the .env file in the server side (backend). Use PostgreSQL to create the database stock_db if not already created, then while in PostgreSQL type "\i schema.sql". Quit PostgresSQL, then open the terminal in the backend preferably in the package.json and "type npm i". After type "npm run dev" to start up port in the backend and it should tell that the server is listening to the specific port it is on and that the database is connected. Next open up another terminal in the frontend prefereably in the package.json and type "npm run dev" as well and a port should open and the application will work. Register and login into the page and look up your Crypto Currencies and Stocks.

## Usage

Use this application to grab data about specific Crypto Currencies and Stocks when searched. The Crypto Currencies and Stocks can be added to a watchlist if wanted.

## Contribution

We were able create a fullstack react application through the utilization of Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize.

## Tests

Run "npm run dev" in the server side (backend) to have the port listen and conect to the database. Then run "npm run dev" in the client side (frontend) to have it's own port open and a web page will run. Since the port in the backend is listening, the frontend will be able to fetch the Crypto Currencies and the Stocks when searched. Any Crypto Currencies or Stocks can then be added to the watchlist.
